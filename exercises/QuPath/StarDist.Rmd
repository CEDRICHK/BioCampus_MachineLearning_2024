A key feature of the QuPath cell detection algorithm is its ability to optionally expand the detected objects (usually nuclei) by a predefined value or until they touch a neighboring cell. This geometric approximation allows for the inference of the whole cell based solely on the nuclear signal.

This capability is also implemented in deep learning-based cell segmentation, which utilizes external software and is integrated as extensions (QuPath's term for plugins).

<u>StarDist</u>, developed by Martin Weigert and Uwe Schmidt, provides excellent 2D and 3D nuclei segmentation. It is available as a Python library and a Fiji plugin, and has also been incorporated into QuPath as an **extension**. StarDist includes a robust 2D pre-trained model and offers a comprehensive set of tools for retraining when needed.

## 1. Install StarDist Extension

- Find the jar file StarDist in the *Extensions* folder, drag & drop it into QuPath window.

- Choose to install in the *default* folder.

- Check the ***Extensions*** to verify that StarDist extension (0.4.0) is included.

## 2. Create Annotation

- Create Annotation of the whole image using ***Objects > Annotations > Create full image annotation*** (Ctrl+Shit+A)

## 3. Run StarDist

- StarDist cannot be run through QuPath GUI but only using a Script. For example, you can use ***Extensions > StarDist H&E nucleus detection script***

- Edit the path the to model file in the *models* folder.

- Click Run
